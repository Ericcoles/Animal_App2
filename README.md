Hello Reader!

Today my Teacher Margit made us rework the animal app we started the previous week. We are learning react basics and it is getting interesting (interesting means hard). I really like the ability to do a lot of things with less work so react is nice.

In the animal app, we are taking images from the website unsplash. We added a like button with a cute heart emoji for users to like the image. We also added an delete button, noted by the x, to remove an image. 

We also added a search function at the top of the page to find specific animals of interest.
